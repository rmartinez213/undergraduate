<h1>This Is Robert's Top 5 Best Assignments</h1>
</br>
Hello there people! This is Robert Martinez and I will be showing the pages that I have created during the course of this class.</br></br>
This class has shown me how to edit and add color to text, add background images to my web page and much much more. </br></br>
I have used stock photos In most of these examples in the following websites.</br></br>


<b><a href="HW1.html"target="_blank">Homework #1:</a> This homework is special to me, because it shows my very first Hype Text MarkUp Language code. This is considered easy. </b>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</p>
<p class="web2">
<a href="HW2.html"target="_blank">Homework #2:</a> I felt this homework was also special, because I was able to see improvement within a week of work. This was also considered easy
</p>
<p class="web3">
<a href="HW7.html"target="_blank">Homework #7:</a> This homework honestly took me some time. Before the whole stock image change, this page was dedicated to the album of Imagine Dragons that was called Smokes and Mirrors that recently came out a the same week I made this. I was able to incorporate all the album arts into the table along with each link that took the user to purchase the song. This homework was time consuming, but yet fun.
</p>
<p class="web4">
<a href="HW8.html"target="_blank">Homework #8:</a> In this homework I tried making a wanna be official web page. The most difficult part about this homework was creating the questions as most of the time I ran out of ideas for the questions I would ask the surveyor. This homework was fun and easy. 
</p>
<p class="web5">
<a href="HW9.html"target="_blank">Homework #9:</a> This homework was by far the hardest as it was difficult to understand JavaScript. I felt it was difficult, because I was over thinking the requirements that I needed on the homework itself. Eventually I was able to understand it through outside sources, which helped me a lot. This homework was confusing and hard, but thankfully I was able to understand it in the end.
