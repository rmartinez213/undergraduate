<H2>My songs know what you did in the dark</H2>
Ooh oh oh oh, ooh oh oh oh
Be careful making wishes in the dark
Can't be sure when they've hit their mark
And besides in the meantime I'm just dreaming of tearing you apart
I'm in the details with the devil
So now the world can never get me on my level
I just got to get you out of the cage
I'm a young lovers rage
Gonna need a spark to ignite
My songs know what you did in the dark
<em>So light em up up up, light em up up up,
light em up up up, I'm on fire</em>
So light em up up up, light em up up up,
light em up up up, I'm on fire
Ooh oh oh oh (In the dark, in the dark)
Ooh oh oh oh (In the dark, in the dark)
All the writers keep writing what they write
Somewhere another pretty vein just dies
I've got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see
That you're the antidote to everything except for me
<strong>A constellation of tears on your lashes
Burn everything you love
Then burn the ashes</strong>
In the end everything collides
My childhood spat back the monster that you see
My songs know what you did in the dark
So light em up up up, light em up up up,
light em up up up, I'm on fire
<b><i>So light em up up up, light em up up up,</i></b>
light em up up up, I'm on fire
Ooh oh oh oh (In the dark, in the dark)
Ooh oh oh oh (In the dark, in the dark)
<strong><b><i>My songs know what you did in the dark</i></b></strong>
My songs know what you did in the dark
So light em up up up, light em up up up,
light em up up up, I'm on fire
So light em up up up, light em up up up,
light em up up up, I'm on fire
Ooh oh oh oh (In the dark, in the dark)
Ooh oh oh oh (In the dark, in the dark)
Ooh oh oh

Lyrics for The Phoenix By Fall Out Boy
Put on your war paint
You are a brick tied to me that's dragging me down
Strike a match and I'll burn you to the ground
We are the jack-o-lanterns in July setting fire to the sky
Here, here comes this rising tide, so come on
Put on your war paint
Cross walks and crossed hearts and hope-to-dies
Silver clouds with grey linings
So we can take the world back from a heart attack
One maniac at a time we will take it back
You know time crawls on when you're waiting for the song to start
So dance alone to the beat of your heart
Hey young blood, doesn't it feel like our time is running out?
I'm gonna change you like a remix
<small>Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
Wearing our vintage misery
No, I think it looked a little better on me</small>
I'm gonna change you like a remix
<small><i>Then I'll raise you like a phoenix</i></small>
Bring home the boys and scrap scrap metal the tanks
Get hitched, make a career out of robbing banks
Because the world is just a teller and we are wearing black masks
"You broke our spirit," says the note we pass
So we can take the world back from a heart attack
One maniac at a time we will take it back
You know time crawls on when you're waiting for the song to start
So dance alone to the beat of your heart
Hey young blood, doesn't it feel like our time is running out?
I'm gonna change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
Wearing our vintage misery
No, I think it looked a little better on me
I'm gonna change you like a remix
<i>Then <b>I'll raise you</b> like a phoenix</i>
Put on your war paint
The war is won, before it's begun
Release the doves, surrender love
The war is won, before it's begun
Release the doves, surrender love
<b>The war <i>is won</i>, before it's begun</b>
Release the doves, surrender love
The war is won, before it's begun (Wave the white flag!)
Release the doves, surrender love (Wave the white flag!)
Hey young blood, doesn't it feel like our time is running out?
I'm gonna change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
Wearing our vintage misery
No, I think it looked a little better on me
I'm gonna change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
Hey young blood, doesn't it feel like our time is running out?
I'm gonna change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
Put on your war paint

<p class="Bimbo">Alone Together</p>
<p class="clash">I don't know where you're going,
But do you got room for one more troubled soul
I don't know where I'm going,
But I don't think I'm coming home
And I said, I'll check in tomorrow if I don't wake up dead
This is the road to ruin and we're starting at the end
Say, yeah
Let's be alone together
We could stay young forever
Scream it from the top of your lungs, lungs, lungs
Say, yeah
Let's be alone together
We can stay young forever
We'll stay young, young, young, young, young
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh
Cut me off, I lost my track
It's not my fault, I'm a maniac
It's not funny anymore, no it's not
My heart is like a stallion, they love it more when it's broken
Do you wanna feel beautiful, do you wanna, yeah
I'm outside the door, let me in
So we can go back and play pretend
I'm on deck, yeah I'm up next
Tonight I'm high as a private jet
'Cause I don't know where you're going,
But do you got room for one more troubled soul
I don't know where I'm going, but I don't think I'm coming home
And I said, I'll check in tomorrow if I don't wake up dead
This is the road to ruin and we're starting at the end
Say, yeah
Let's be alone together
We could stay young forever
Scream it from the top of your lungs, lungs, lungs
Say, yeah
Let's be alone together
We can stay young forever
We'll stay young, young, young, young, young
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh
My heart is like a stallion, they love it more when it's broken
Do you wanna feel beautiful, do you wanna, yeah
I'm outside the door, invite me in
So we can go back and play pretend
I'm on deck, yeah I'm up next
Tonight I'm high as a private jet
Yeah
Let's be alone together
We could stay young forever
Scream it from the top of your lungs, lungs, lungs
Say, yeah
Let's be alone together
We can stay young forever
We'll stay young, young, young, young, young
I don't know where you're going,
But do you got room for one more troubled soul
I don't know where I'm going, but I don't think I'm coming home
And I said, I'll check in tomorrow if I don't wake up dead
This is the road to ruin and we're starting at the end
