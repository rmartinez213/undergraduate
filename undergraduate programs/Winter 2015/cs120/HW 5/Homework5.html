Today at this year's DICE developer summit, <b>Treyarch's Mark Lamia revealed the time he almost cut the zombies mode from 

Call of Duty: World at War. While World at War was in development</b>, a small group of programmers spent their off-time working on

a Nazi zombies prototype just for fun. Since the game was in crunch, and <i><b>zombies didn't fit with the franchise's</b></i> setting, Lamia

considered telling them to stop wasting time and focus on the <i>primary game. It was a move he described as something "that would

have been the biggest mistake of my career." In the end, he calmed down</i><h3>and tried out the mode himself. It turned out to be really

fun, and Lamia felt it would be a worthwhile addition to the game.</h3> But trying to convince the franchise's leadership was another

uphill battle and some people even thought it would be a "disgrace to the franchise." The team continued working on the mode in

the background, and tried using word of mouth to spread how enjoyable the mode was, rather than pitching it directly to higher-ups

at the studio. However, Call of Duty's marketing and PR teams felt it was confusing and too off-brand to fit with the Call 

of Duty franchise. Back then in 2008, Lamia sad trying to sell a Call of Duty Zombies game would have

felt like the series had jumped the shark. That's why it was put in World at War as an easter egg that could only be accessed by

players who had beat the main campaign. Eventually after launch, the zombie mode became so popular that it was unlocked through a

patch. The fiction for the zombie universe evolved over time and was driven in a large part by fans and their speculation and message

board posting. But even with Black Ops, there was no branding, PR, or marketing around the game's zombies mode. Lamia described it as

a blessing in disguise, since it gave fans of the game a way to continue interacting with the game in a more viral sense. Kind of

like the zombie virus itself. Lamia didn't reveal any details on what type of Call of Duty Treyarch is working on next, but given the

nature of the talk, it's safe to assume there will be zombies.



However...Now that we take a look at the past zombies maps, you would see the evolution of the now exclaimed game mode on the call of duty franchise.

<strong>
The story starts with Der Riese (which is 'The Giant' in English) where German scientists are developing teleportation devices<br/><br/>
to help win World War 2. The scientists tested the teleporteres on SS Honour Guard soldiers, however, they didn't appear at that<br/><br/>
other end and some DID appear where they were supposed to, but were reverted to a zombie-like state.Some scientists at Der Riese<br/><br/>
got their hands on some <i>zombies to test on. The scientists at Der Riese including Ludvig Maxis and Edward Richtofen were trying<br/><br/>
to find out what had happened to their test subjects.</i><b>At the time Richtofen was deveoping the Wunderwaffe DG-2,the Ray-Gun(possibly the DG1),<br/><br/>
the Random Weapon Box and the Monkey Bomb. Maxis was testing the zombies behavior; all tests failed.</b> Maxis had a daughter called Samantha Maxis.<br/><br/>
Ludvig bought her a puppy named Fluffy, secretly intending to use the dog and it's offspring (Fluffy was pregnant) as new test subjects for the <br/><br/>
teleporters. Fluffy then had numerous babies which were all used in the teleporters, including Fluffy. The dogs appeared at the teleporters<br/><br/>
as Hellhounds. Ludvig and Richtofen were doing experiments on Fluffy when Samantha entered the room. Whilst Ludvig and Samantha were arguing<br/><br/>
Edward slowly backed out of the room. He then went insane he sealed the two of them in the room and released the zombified Fluffy.<br/><br/>
It then proceeded to tear apart the two and soon they were both dead.Samantha came back as a kind of ghost zombie with two forms.<br/><br/>

<p class="green">Kino Der Toten Story Line</p>
<br/>
One is the innocent girl giggles when you receive her <i>teddy</i> from the <b>random box</b> where she moves it to another location or as her zombie form<br/><br/>
the voice that comes up when you get droppables from zombies ex:<sub>insta-kill</sub>, double-points etc.The Wunderwaffe runs on a very dangerous much<br/><br/>
sought after element called element <sup>115</sup> - I don't know who made the pack-a-punch probably Richtofen as well. In real life a meteorite fell to <br/><br/>
Earth and broke off into pieces, the pieces fell to Earth. People believed it brought the dead to life. Energy from the meteorites interfered <br/><br/>
with the teleporters at Der Riese and re-directed them. One meteorite all the humans went to and one all the dogs. The human one was about a<br/><br/>
mile away from <p class="something">Nacht Der Untoten</p>, the dogs went to the meteorite just outside Shi No Numa. The dogs could teleport at will the <br/><br/>
humans would only go every month or so to an area of unusual electric activity all the power from Verruckt and Der Riese and the other<br/><br/>
meteorite at Shi No Numa. In Nacht Der Untoten a team of United States of America Marine Company soldiers are sent out to investigate Der Reise,<br/><br/>
but they were shot down over Natch Der Untoten, where the zombies mentioned above had teleported to. The crash wasn't too bad and everyone survived<br/><br/>
but there captin which is the dude getting hit in the face by the zombie in the begining. After fighting hordes of zombies they escape and warn the<br/><br/>
American government. Verruckt is where the research at Der Riese was moved to and where an American spy named Peter is working. Richtofen finishes<br/><br/>

<b><i>Mob Of The Dead Story Line</i></b>

During the 1920s, prohibition-era America, mob boss Salvatore DeLuca built a large empire from GAMBLING, prostitution, and the distribution of alcohol.<br/><br/>
Sal was eventually arrested by the police, along with fellow mobsters Billy Handsome, Michael "Finn" O'Leary and Albert "The Weasel" Arlington. They were<br/><br/>
all imprisoned on Alcatraz Island, where they were to serve hefty sentences. Arlington, however, devised a plan to escape the island on a makeshift<br/><br/>
aircraft designed by himself. He somehow convinced Sal, Billy, and Finn to PARTICIPATE in the escape plan, but soon enough the joint effort between them<br/><br/>
descended into quarrels and fighting, and, after numerous complications, the three mobsters became bitter towards Arlington. The plan was quickly abandoned,<br/><br/>
and the plane was never constructed, much to the frustration of the mobsters. Still angry at Arlington for the failure of the plan, Sal, Billy and Finn<br/><br/>
constructed makeshift weapons and lured Arlington onto the roof of the prison, where they attacked him and left him to bleed to death, on the night of <br/><br/>
December 31st, 1933. For the murder of Arlington, the three were sentenced to death by electric chair. Their execution came on the morning of January 19th, 1934.<br/><br/>
However, after their death sentence, the group were sent back in time to the night of December 31st, 1933, in an alternate iteration of Alcatraz Prison which<br/><br/>
is inhabited entirely by zombies and a guard by the name of Brutus. With no memory of Arlington's murder or the failure of the escape plan, they set out to<br/><br/>
build Arlington's plane and attempt to escape. Their escape is failed after they crash on the Golden Gate Bridge. Eventually, the four mobsters are killed by<br/><br/>
zombies, then reappear in the prison again and start building the plane again, resulting in an endless loop and making escape impossible. With no escape, the<br/><br/>
mobsters attempt something else. They learn that, in reality, they are all dead, and their escape plan never came to be. Remembering everything, the mobsters<br/><br/>
once again set out to kill Arlington.<br/><br/>
