Homework 2

- Problem 1 - Zip -

This program implements object oriented programming.

This program has 2 main functions. First it converts a five digit zip code into a barcoded language (this barcoded
language was created by the professor). The user enters their zip code and the program then returns the barcode.
Example: 95014 becomes ||:|:::|:|:||::::::||:|::|:::|||

The second main function of the program is when it converts the carcode into the zip code. The user enters the
barcode and it returns the zip code.
Example: ||:|:::|:|:||::::::||:|::|:::||| becomes 95014
