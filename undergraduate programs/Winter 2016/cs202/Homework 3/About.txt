Homework 3

- Problem 3 - Stock market from CSV -
This program implements object oriented programming.

In order to run this program you must first implement the CSV file contained in this folder.
I placed the CSV file in my IDE (Eclipse) and was recognized, so you may need to change the directory 
if you plan on using a different IDE or running this program.

This program recognizes the CSV file and is stored into an Arraylist object upon entering the Parse Data option.
You can also add stocks, delete stocks and write the new stocks onto the csv file with the save feature in the
menu.

Parse the input file and use the data to populate the variables for StockPrices. One line of the input file
corresponds to one StockPrice object, so you should create as many objects as necessary to hold all of the
data from the file. In each line of the input file, the first value is the date in the format mm/dd/yyyy;
this needs to be parsed further into the month, day, and year, which are separate variables in StockPrice.
The second value is the stock symbol, which represents the name of the stock; it is usually an abbreviation
of the name of the company issuing the stock. The next value is the opening price of the stock for that day,
the price when the market opened in the morning. The final value is the price of the last sale before the market
closed. Choose a StockPrice from the array list and delete it. Show the current list of stock prices,
including their dates and all other fields. The ArrayList of StockPrice objects and write the data to a
file. The output should be formatted the same way as the given input file. The date should be put back together,
and each piece of data in the object should be separated by commas. given file name as a string argument and
parse the file.
