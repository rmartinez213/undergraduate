Midterm

CS202 midterm consisted of validating a user string input. The validation was created using two arrays. One ascending array
while the other array consisted of the descending position of the word. The arrays were then compared in a loop from 
ascending position to descending. The program will return what the user entered along with a validation stating whether what
was entered is a palindrone or not.

Object oriented programming was also implemented, but this program/midterm was mainly focusing on the palindrone aspect.
