Homework 1 

- Problem 1 - Payroll -
This program implements object oriented programming. 

When first launched there will be a menu diplayed. Based on user commands you can choose from
either employee list, issue paycheck, set hours, add employee, delete employee or exit. Employee
list will display all the employees in the system. Issue paycheck will issue all the paychecks to
all the employees, reset the amount of hours worked and display the total amount in the paycheck.
Set hours will have you input the EmployeeID and hours worked. Upon entering both, the information
is then stored into the program. Add will allow you add an employee to the payroll. Delete will allow
you delete an employee from the payroll using their EmployeeID. Lastly, none will close the program.
