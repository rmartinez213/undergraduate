Consider the following set of processes, with the length of the CPU burst given in milliseconds:


           Process      Burst Time      Priority     Arrival Time
               P1                2      2                 0
               P2                1      1                 1
               P3                8      4                 2               
               P4                4      2                 3
        




a.     Draw four Gantt charts that illustrate the execution of these processes using the following scheduling algorithms: FCFS, SJF, nonpreemptive priority (a larger priority number implies a higher priority), and RR (quantum = 2).
b.     What is the turnaround time of each process for each of the scheduling algorithms in part a?
c.     What is the waiting time of each process for each of these scheduling algorithms?
d.     Which of the algorithms results in the minimum average waiting time (over all processes)?
