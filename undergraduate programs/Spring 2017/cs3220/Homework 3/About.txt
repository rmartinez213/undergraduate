Customer list

- Homework 3 - List -

Customer list is a program that uses an Array list to create a table in which the user can add, edit or delete
items from the list. This table features the ability to search any name by using the search bar. The search feature is implemented
by using a form in jsp and setting that parameter and then calling the post method of the servlet. Upon getting to the post method, 
the method then grabs the attribute from the jsp file and is stored onto a string variable. The string variable is then compared with 
all the names in the bean and the result is then stored to an attribute. The servlet then redirects back to the jsp and displays the
results with the filtered list.
