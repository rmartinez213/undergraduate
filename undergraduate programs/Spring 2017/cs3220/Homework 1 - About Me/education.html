                    Here is an image of my high school teacher and I
                    during my senior year. His name is Randell Rodgers and
                    he has encouraged me to do my best in school by motivating 
                    me with words and his passion for helping students. He has
                    always had a connection with his students inlcuding myself.
                    I had him for chemistry my junior year, as well as for a video 
                    production class that he was currently teaching at the time.
                    It was great seeing how enthusiastic he was about chemistry. The
                    labs we conducted in his class were you beyond interesting and
                    nothing like any other science class I've taken, because the labs
                    were very intuitive.

                This is an image of my friends and I, along with my professor from STEP (Summer Transition to ECST).
                This was a very memorable experience for me, because I was able to make new friends and learn about the
                campus and the resource that are provided. In this Summer transition program I was able to pass both my exit exams
                on my first attempt. It was difficult for me to manage my time, because I wanted to enjoy my break by relaxing, but
                pass my exit exam. I was very proud of myself to have dedicate my whole summer doing this program.
