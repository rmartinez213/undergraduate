Word Guessing Game

This program was created using Java FX.

Word guessing game is a program that is identical to hang man. However instead of displaying a hanging person,
the program displays circles. The circles represent how many attmepts you have left before solving the word. 
A word is randomly generated, and the user has to enter a letter on each attempt. Upon entering each letter,
the program displays if the user is correct or wrong. Upon losing or winning the user is then asked if they
want to play the game again.

The program randomly selects a word from a preseted array. The correct letters replace each '_'. 
There is also a counter variable that decrements each time that the user gets an incorrect letter.
Each correct letter and incorrect letter is stored to a variable as well so that it displays the
incorrect letters to the user, so that they know what letters were entered previously. The program 
will set the radius of each circle to zero (hence disappearing) for each wrong response.
