Time Sorting

This program implements Java FX.

This program is meant to test the efficiency of each algorithm by getting the time of each inidivdual algorithm
and it's different array sizes. The program implements 6 different algorithms. Selection sort, insertion sort,
bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort, heap sort are the six different algorithms. Each algorithm has six different
array sizes (to test sized arrays). The variables are then returned and printed to a pane.
