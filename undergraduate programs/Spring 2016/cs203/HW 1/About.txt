H Tree

This program was created using Java FX. 

H tree is a program that displays a number of sequential H's based on the amount that the user enters
into a text box. The set up for the scene and the border came first as those were initially the requirements for
the assignment. A setOnAction was created so that when the user clicks "enter" then it submits the number into the
setOrder method and thus call the paint method so it can then display the H. The H is then created using points and
connecting them via the H  and linear algebra. Lastly, the H is created using recursion.
