Backtracking

This program implements Java fX.

The program is meant to implement a backtracking to an 8x8. Simply, their is an algorithm that is used to
verify that each queen does not hit another queen diagonly, side to side or up to down. Backtracking will
allow the program to backtrack if it cannot complete a successful solution. This program can be somewhat
compared to finding to a solution to sudoku.
