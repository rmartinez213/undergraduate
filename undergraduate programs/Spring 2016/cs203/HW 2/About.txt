Homework 2

- Problem 1 - Koch snowflake

This program implements Java FX.

This program is similar to the last homework as it implements the same style of Java FX. Instead
of creating reaccuring Hs we will now create reaccuring Koch snowflakes. These snowflakes will be 
reaccuring greater as the user enters a bigger number. The action event is triggered when the user
enters a numbers and clicks the "enter" key. Upon clicking that key, it then calls the setOrder method that 
will pass in the data and call the paint method. The paint method then creates how many reaccuring koch
snowflakes based on the number that the user entered. The koch snowflakes are then created using 2d points
and lines.
