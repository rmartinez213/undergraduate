Heap Sort

- Max Heapify -

First, the program contains an pre-sorted array which would be considered the nodes of a heap tree.
The program first calls the HeapSort method which then calls the Build_Max_Heap tree adn creates the heap tree.
However, the heap tree is not yet sorted yet.

The heap tree is then sorted by the "Max_Heapify" method where it conducts all the operations of sorting the algorithm,
specifically line 37-39.

for(int i = (int)Math.floor(A.length / 2) ; i >= 0 ; i--){
	Max_Heapify(A, i);
}
