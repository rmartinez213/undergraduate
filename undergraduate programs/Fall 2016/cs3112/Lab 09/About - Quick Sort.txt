QuickSort

- QuickSort & Randomize QuickSort -

The quicksort has a divide and conquer design. The program first implements the non randomized quick sort algorithm.
The program then creates the pivot (the pivot is the last index in the array). If the pivot is less than the j element
than do nothing, however if the pivot is greater than j element then you increment the i and then swap the j 
index with the i index. Upon getting to the end of the array, the pivot is then swapped with the index of i + 1.

The samething is done with another array that is randomized (which is much more efficient if the array is not sorted such that 5, 4, 3, 2, 1).
