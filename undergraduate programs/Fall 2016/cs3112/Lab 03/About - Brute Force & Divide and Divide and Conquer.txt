Max Sub Array

- Stocks and Maxsub -

First, brute force algorithm is implemented in order to determine which day to buy and sell stocks. This is accomplished
by creating a double for loop that will set new max for everytime the loop iterates and checks to see if the value is greater
than the previous. The i value is then stored to a variable, so we could print to the user which day to buy and sell.

Lastly, the maxsub implements a divide and conquer method. We do this by making it recursive iterate recursively
and applying the divide and conquer so that the time efficiency is nlogn (instead of n^2 like brute force).
