Merge sort

- Merge Sort -

This program consists of creating a merge sort for my Analysis of Algorithms class.
Merge sort consisted of creating 3 different arrays. The original array has the data of the unsorted list,
while the two other arrays are used for the sorting. The Left side of the array is given values of the left most of
the array, while the right of the array is given the second half of the array. The values are ultimetly sorted as 
a divide and conquer technique.
