- Problem 1 - Two card poker in Python! -

Two card poker in python is similar to poker, but instead it is using only two cards.

The program is comprised of a map, a list of randomly shuffled numbers, and a list that has concatenated ranks and suits.
The user is then asked if they want to play and will ask the user how much they are willing to bet. The user will
then recieve two cards. The two cards of the user has to be higher than the two cards of the opponent, but the user 
can only see 1 card that the opponent recieved from the deck. 

The rank is based on the card that the player got and is then modded (%) by 13.

0 - two to of hearts...  8 - ten of hearts... 9 - Jack of hearts 10 - Queen of hearts 11 - King of hearts 12 - Ace of hearts

Suit is based on the value of the card that the player got and is then divided (/) by 13.

0 - Hearts
1 - Clubs
2 - Diomonds
3 - Spades

The user loses if they bet more than what they have and lose that bet or if they lose all their money.
