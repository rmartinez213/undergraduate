- Problem1 - Four Card Roshambo


Roshambo is the classic rock, paper, scissors game. This is a card game involving a deck of 66 cards, 22 of which
have a picture of a rock, 22 have a picture of a piece of paper, and 22 have a picture of a pair of scissors.
The game starts as follows: The player and the house are each dealt four cards. The player is asked to make a bet
that he will win the hand, with the winner of the hand (and bet) being determined by who scores the most points 
(in the event of a tie, the house wins). The dealer reveals his first card. The player then chooses a card to
play. A point is scored by whoever wins, or no points if it is a tie. The player then reveals a card, and the
computer plays a card (assume perfect play). The hand continues, alternating who reveals first, until all four
cards are played. The player receives the bet amount from the dealer if he wins, otherwise that amount is
deducted from the player's account. If the player decides, a new hand is dealt and play repeated. Play ends when
the player runs out of money, or he chooses to quit. 

Not all that was mentioned above was implemented. Like most of the gameplay is not implemented.
The card shuffle and appropriate string representation is implemented.
