- Linked List - Split Linked List, Replace Nodes, Print Nodes, Deletes Nodes -

The first functionaility is adding the nodes to the linked list and printing the nodes as well. This was done by creating a for loop
and adding all the nodes to the linked list and then iterating the nodes as they are printed in a while loop. 

Values divisble by 3 are replaced by 100 and values that are divisble by 10 is replaced with 1000. The pointer for each
value is changed from the current node to the headnode, so after each itteration, the pointer node (current) is changed.

The linked list is then iterated and deletes the values that are greater than 50 (Only the nodes with 100 and 1000 are deleted).

Split linked list is a linked list split in half. Half containing only the first linked list, while the second half contains the
other half of the linked list. This is the same linked list from the list that had deleted the nodes with a value > 50.
