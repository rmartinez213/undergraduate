Lab1 

- Problem 1 - Introduction to C++ -

This was my first C++ program and it consisted of how it is build (in terms of it's skeleton).
Considering the '#include <iostream>' is a neccessity in order to print to the console. 
This assignment just consisted of printing to the console as majority of the class time was spent on
downloading and configuring C++ to our IDE.
