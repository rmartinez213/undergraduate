1. Nested functions are functions with in a function. This is typically seen from aggregated
 functions if we want to find something specific.

2.It's not an error, because "HAVING" filters after the aggregated, while WHERE clause filter
 before the aggregated function. Therby causing an error.

3. Aggregated Function
-MAX
-MIN
-COUNT
Non Aggregated Function
-Month
-WeekDay
-Year

4. This will make a table that shows the manufactures (make), then in another column it would
 display how many total their are, excludes toyota as well.

5.It still returns a function, because the WHERE clause had initially filtered the Nulls thereby
 allowing the aggregated function to display the correct result.

6. Initially we get the day of the week from the nested function, where inside we subtract the
 curent date from 11 years.

7.In this query we display the titleID and display the track titiles, from the tracks table
 but it group them as by using the titleID

8. This query counts how many artists begin in the name "The" anthing other than "The" will not be considered an artist.

9. This query displays salesID, lastName and how many titleIDs, but it adds another row, because it recognizes that there are 2 salesID.

10. SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT SalesID) AS 'SalesPeople' FROM Studios JOIN SalesPeople USING(SalesID);
