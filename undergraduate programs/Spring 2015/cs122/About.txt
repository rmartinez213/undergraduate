Class: cs122 (Introduction to Relational Databases)
Taken: Spring 2015

About: cs122 Introduction to Relational Databasesand the SQL; database design
using Entity-Relationship, relational, and object-oriented data modeling; database
implementation; use of SQL, including selection, join, subquery, aggregation, and transaction. 
My second programming class consisted of seting up and use at least one mainstream database
management system. Use the SQL query language to express compound search conditions,
combine and process data from multiple columns or tables, and format the results into
user-friendly reports.

Notice: I do not have the original sql file that was used in class, because I had the file in my 
previous laptop. The files in the folders have been untouched since that semester just as my other
classes here on github. Some of my files do not have sql commands, but rather answers to questions
that were given.
